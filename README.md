## 🛠️ Want to do the same?

If you want to extract original Minecraft textures for educational or personal use, here’s what you need to do:

1. **Purchase a legal copy of Minecraft**  
   Make sure you own the game. You can buy it from [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net).

2. **Locate the game files**  
   - On Windows:  
     `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\versions\<version>\<version>.jar`  
   - On macOS:  
     `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/versions/<version>/<version>.jar`  
   - On Linux:  
     `~/.minecraft/versions/<version>/<version>.jar`

3. **Extract the JAR file**  
   A `.jar` file is just a ZIP archive. You can open it with any archive manager (like 7-Zip or WinRAR). Inside, you’ll find the textures under `assets/minecraft/textures/`.

4. **Use responsibly**  
   Only use the extracted textures for **non-commercial**, **educational**, or **personal** projects. Do not redistribute them as your own or try to sell them.

## 🎯 Why I Did This

I chose to extract and organize the textures this way because it makes them much easier to **navigate**, **edit**, and **reuse** later — especially when working on things like:

- 🎨 Custom **resource packs**
- 🔧 Experimental **visual tweaks**
- 🧪 Texture-related **prototyping**

Keeping them in a structured folder allows me to quickly find what I need without having to dig through the game files each time. It’s a clean and practical setup for anyone who wants to tinker with Minecraft’s visuals on a deeper level.
